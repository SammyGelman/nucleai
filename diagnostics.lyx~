\begin_layout Section
Causes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Checkpoints and formation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mitosis system evolved to have checkpoints in place:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
nucleolus not divided
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
sufficient skin growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different rates for cells, the cell cycle is highly controlled:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
skin -> high
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
neurons -> low
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
red blood doesnt ever
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cancer is the uncontrolled and rapid division of cells.
 The mass of cancer cells forms tumors.
 The rapid and unchecked division of cells leads to further mutation which
 can cause cells to leave their primary sites and form satellite tumors
 in a process called metastasis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cancer Genetics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mutations which take place on genes that control cell division directly
 are called Oncogenes and lead to uncontrolled proliferation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also genes that act as tumor suppressors, these are often recessive
 and both copies of the genes need to be effected in order to cause the
 uncontrolled proliferation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Example: Gene p53
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gene which codes for a protein that acts as a transcriptionial regulator
 that attaches DNA and turns genes on.
 It plays roles in tumor suppression, DNA damage repair, triggers cell division
 and initiating cell growth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The amino acids located at the center of the p53 protein controls its ability
 to regulate transcription of genes necessary for either cell division or
 cell death according to the organsiams needs.
 It is mutations of the gene of the p53 protein here which eventually lead
 to cancer formations via uncontrolled transcription genes controlling cell
 proliferation.

\begin_layout Standard
Cell arrangements in a tissue can be categorized in a number of ways on
 the spectrum between healthy tissue to tumor formation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Normal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hyperplasia - increase in the number of cells in the tissue while still
 appearing normal under a microscope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Neoplasia - uncontrolled hyperplasia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dysplasia - cells begin to appear abnormal but are not yet cancer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Caption Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The left image shows an example of an invading epithelial cancer.
 The circled blue region in the middle of the slide, just below the drawn
 arrows, shows a thick collection of inflammatory cells.
 Above that is an extremely thick hyperplasia of epithelium.
 The basement membrane, which remained fully intact to the left of the inflamed
 region, has been fully broken down.
 Beneath the inflammatory cells is what appears to be a region of desmoplasia.

\begin_layout Standard
There a three main tissue responses to neoplasia:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Desmoplasia: A stromal response as a reactive formation of connective tissue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Inflammatory response: inflammatory cells rush in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vasucular: angiogenis of new blood cells - hard to tell in slide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure

 shows an image taken by a light microscope where the desmoplasia and the
 inflamatory respose can be clearly seen as well as a rupture of the basement
 membrane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Basement Membrane 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basement membrane is an important structural feature when talking about
 epithelial cell histology.
 It acts as a structural support for epithelial cells and which forms a
 separation between tissues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basement layer describes what you see using a light microscope while
 the basal lamina and the reticular lamina, two separate parts of the basement
 layer, can be seen using an electron microscope.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cancers will uncontrollably replicate and push against the basement membrane
 until the developing tumor finally ruptures through.
 The three physiological responses mentioned above are meant to prevent
 and prepare for that moment.

\begin_inset Caption Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This image of oral cancer shows the bizarre irrgularities of shape and size
 often found in cancers.
 Not the large and multinucleated cells in the middle to the small cells
 surrounding them.
 The chromatin is seen to mare a seperation between the cells.
 Also note the surrounding nearly white desmoplasia around the cancer cells,
 bordering the sides.

The ABCDE of diagnosis 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Anapalesia - cells don't follow regular tissue organization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bizarre - cells are not uniform and irregular in shape and size, large cells
 are generally the cancerous ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Chromatin - extra chromatin, darker than usual cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Displasia - displaced growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Edges - well defined or messy edges.
 The messy edges point to cancer.
